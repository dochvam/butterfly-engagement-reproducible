# Identification ease, wing pattern diversity, and family explain taxonomic bias in butterfly observations

This subdirectory contains input code for reproducing the analyses described in
the paper. It includes a few files harmonizing species taxonomy across different data sources; a taxonomic tree, "ultra_bi.tre", used for visualizations; and the eButterfly observation data.

Due to Github file size limits, you will need to manually retrieve the iNaturalist data from GBIF at [this link](https://doi.org/10.15468/dl.rhmxtn) and add it to this directory.
